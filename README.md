A small playground for ai made 5/25/243

For anyone reading this, the "main.py" file consists of a Bot based in reinforcement learning algorithm q learning. Its super inefficient and unwiedly, but its the only one I really get the math to.
The other one, "policy.py", is my attempt at the beginnings of a policy gradient. Unfortunantly, as you might see, it isn't working all too well, as while I have a makeshift 'policy' built together, the actual gradient is another story.
